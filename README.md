# NIBE Provider for OAuth 2.0 Client

This package provides [NIBE Uplink](https://nibeuplink.com/) OAuth 2.0 support for the PHP League's [OAuth 2.0 Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client).

## Installation

To install, use composer:

```
composer require olssonm/oauth2-nibe
```

## Usage

Usage is the same as The League's OAuth client, using `Olssonm\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Nibe` as the provider.

### Authorization Code Flow

```php
$provider = new Olssonm\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Nibe([
    'clientId'          => 'XXXXXX',
    'clientSecret'      => 'XXXXXX',
    'redirectUri'       => 'https://my.example.com/your-redirect-url/'
]);
```

For further usage of this package please refer to the [core package documentation on "Authorization Code Grant"](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com/usage#authorization-code-grant).

### Resource owner information

NIBE does not support access to any personal information of the authorizing resource owner. As such, this package does not support the `getResourceOwner` method documented in the core package.

This package will throw a `Olssonm\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\ResourceOwnerException` exception if you attempt to use this method.
